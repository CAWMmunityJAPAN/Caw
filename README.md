# Approach and Reasoning
A decentralized social network comes with a number of difficult problems, especially when the
primary source of truth (the etherum blockchain) requires significant fees to store data.

The proposed approach (as implied by <a href='https://caw.is'>CAW manifesto</a>)
is to have a second source of truth, a decentralized database (possibly ARWeave),
along side the ethereum blockchain.

Due to the open nature of a decentralized database, anyone will be able to post anything to
this database, which allows for many avenues of data injection attacks. The following is a
list of security requirements, and their proposed solutions.
